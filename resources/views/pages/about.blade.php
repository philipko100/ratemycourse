        <p>Philip Yungu Ko, the main developer of this site, wanted to see the usefulness of COMM 280 and whether he will learn something new that
            he didn't already in his other business courses. He quickly realized he cannot find a site that have reviews of courses in his university.
            This pushed him to make the site himself.
            <br>
            The purpose of this site is for students to share their views on the content and the structure of the courses they took to help
            other students pick their courses. Our mission is to minimize students' wasted times on taking courses they realize has no use.
            We want students to choose courses that will have the most usefulness to their career and that is strucutred in a way they learn best.
            Some students learn best by participating. Those students can browse our website to look for courses that encourage lots of participation,
            and cut wasted time.
